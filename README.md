# Fire Emblem Graphics Repository

This is a public free to use and (sometimes) free to edit repository of graphics for Fire Emblem romhacking, Tactile Game creation, and Lex Talionis game creation. There are probably other Fire Emblem game creation tools that can use the resources in this repository, too.

This repository contains: Portraits, battle animations, map sprites, music files, and countless other assorted resources people might like to use.

All battle animations are F2E. Many other resources are F2E, but some are only F2U. Not sure what that means? Check this thread for more info:

Note that if something is not listed as F2E, it's probably F2U. That being said, I am a busy person and really don't have a lot of time to update thousands of files or compile walls of credits, hence you should view that topic if you're uncertain regarding some resource's usability. You can just assume a resource is F2U to be safe, but checking with the original creator for F2E permissions is preferable when unlisted.

Currently, the Battle Animations folder offers previews for files on the Github website. Just scroll down on any page inside the Battle Animation folders and you'll see gifs and previews of the animations:

If you go inside any specific animation's folder, you will also find credits for that animation.

Looking for Class Cards and Map Sprites? Check inside each directory subfolder, and you'll see a folder for the class cards and map sprites posted inside that folder. They are the folders that start with [AAA].

If you scroll down to the bottom of those folders, you'll also see previews for the map sprites and class cards.

The repository currently does not have previews for anything other than battle animations, map sprites, and class cards. In the future, I would like to add portraits, CGs, and all that other fun stuff.
